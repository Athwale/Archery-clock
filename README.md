## V1
Older obsolete design build on Raspberry pi 2. Controlled by a wired switch box.

## V2
Current design which uses Raspberry pi 3 and is controlled over wi-fi using a smartphone or other computer. Built to be more modular and easier to build or repair. 

## PCBs
The pcb designs are exported from copper side and must be mirror flipped on the board. To produce correct pcb.  
Check the position of pin 1 on the microcontroller (left top square pad in the design) for reference.
